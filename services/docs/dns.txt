## DEV TESTING ##
* Use this for dev testing when changing around DNS doesn't matter.
* Changing DNS for any dev.* names will not mess anything up that's
* running live.
dev.tornado.app.graffcityapp.com
dev.fapws.app.graffcityapp.com

## LIVE ##
* These are the live DNS names. Once everything is up and running do
* not change these.
tornado.app.graffcityapp.com
fapws.app.graffcityapp.com

## SCALE TESTING ##
* These are names used to trigger scale testing. The intentions are to
* use these two names to point to a load balancer running the server
* application. The server application will see these incoming host
* names and switch it's connection to sclsql.graffcityapp.com.
tornado.sclapp.graffcityapp.com
fapws.sclapp.graffcityapp.com

## SQL ##
* This is the live sql host name.
sql.graffcityapp.com
* If the server application catches an incoming host name from the above
* SCALE TESTING names, the application uses this as the connection host.
* When scale testing is initiated this should point to whatever is used
* to balance mysql clusters.
sclsql.graffcityapp.com

## STORAGE ##
* This is the DNS name for storage. Once the app is live and running this
* should point to whatever storage system is used. This should map to
* the folder/container/bucket that holds the GRAFFCITY tag images.
storage.graffcityapp.com
