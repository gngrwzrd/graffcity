#PRE-REQUISITES
-Nginx 0.8.43
-MySQL 5.X
-Python 2.6
-Tornado http://www.tornadoweb.org/
-libev for FAPWS
 -MAC: sudo port install libev
 -YUM: sudo yum install libev
-FAPWS http://www.fapws.org/
-MySQLdb (python)
-Grizzled (python)
-Boto
-Memcache
-**See the pythonlibs folder for zips of libraries you can install**

#NGINX
-Use the conf/nginx_configure file as a template for building nginx
-See the conf/nginx.conf file for a nginx conf template - you'll need to
 change this to suit your environment (paths).

#DATABASE
-Install MySQL
-Create a user (allcity / kdile8dkasdf8)
-Only allow the allcity use to do select, insert, delete, update.
-Create new table (allcity)
-Run the provided db.sql file for structure and initial fixtures.

#MEMCACHE
-By default, the application reads the app/cache file. if it's content
 is "on", the database layer tries to use memcache. If it's content is
 "off", the database layer doesn't use cache.
-You can toggle the state of memcache during runtime by hitting one of
 these routes:
 http://app.allcity.com/cache/on
 http://app.allcity.com/cache/off

#DEV TESTING
-You'll need to setup the host entries above
-You'll need mysql setup
-You'll need nginx up and running with the provided configuration template
-You'll need the application running from tornado. By default nginx
 is configured to proxy requests over to one of four tornado instances.
-Once all of that is setup, you can get it running with:
 >>sudo nginx
 >>./scripts/raise_tornado.sh
-Hit http://app.allcity.com/test/ to double check that it's up and running.

#MONIT
-If you use monit, you can include the monit/allcity.monit config file.
