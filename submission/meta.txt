GRAFFCITY

Graffcity turns your iPhone into a can of Krylon® and the entire world into your canvas.

Virtually tag everything, anywhere, at any scale. Just hold your phone up and spray. Tag a wall, deface a friend’s car, or do an entire building. Nothing is off limits. Create unique artwork and 100% legit tags with the fully customizable spray modes like orange tip. Upload tags to your profile, Facebook, or your camera roll. Once uploaded, the augmented reality mode uses GPS to give you a real-time live street view of other people’s virtual tags. Explore, rate, and view other tagger’s creations. Graffcity gets you as close to the real thing without breaking the law (or mother nature).
